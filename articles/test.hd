#p it is a utf8 file, and below we will add a table
#tab
    #th[0] index
    #ths[1]
        #p name
        #p location
    #
    #td[0][0] 1
    #tds[0][1]
        #p hake
        #p bit
    #
#
#p notice that the content inside every cell of the created table is not designed for large text blocks.
#a and if you need to express the idea, please {#img[src=test.png]} use the sections. 
so what will happen if we set a code block here?
#c[lang=C#][brush=CSharp]
public static int main(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
#
#c[lang=C#][brush=csharp]
public static int main(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
#
#c[lang=C++][brush=cpp]
int main(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
